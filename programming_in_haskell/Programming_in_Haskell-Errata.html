<h3> Programming in Haskell -- Errata</h3>


<ul>
<p>
</p><li> Pages 7, 8, 9 and 11.  Appendix B shows how the special
Haskell symbols that are used in the book are typed using a
normal keyboard.  This appendix is mentioned on page 12, but
should have been mentioned earlier and more prominently.

<p>
</p></li><li> Page 20. The additional "such as" in the second paragraph
should be removed.

<p>
</p></li><li> Page 24. The phrase "is a instance" in the explanation of the type
of + should be "is an instance".

<p>
</p></li><li> Pages 23, 42, 43, 62, 64, 71, 72, 79 and 80.
The use of library functions on characters requires the <em>Char</em>
library to be loaded, otherwise the Hugs system will produce an error.
See the entry for pages 158 and 159 below for further details.

<p>
</p></li><li> Page 44. The library function <em>fromInt</em> has
been replaced by a more general function called <em>fromIntegral</em>. (*)

<p>
</p></li><li> Page 57. The word "removing" in the second paragraph should be
"remove".

<p>
</p></li><li> Page 60. The type for <em>halve</em> in exercise 5 should be
as follows: (*)

<pre>   halve :: [a] -&gt; ([a],[a])
</pre>

<p>
</p></li><li> Page 66.  The definition for the append operator ++ using
<em>foldr</em> is not valid Haskell, due to the use of a section
on the left-hand side of the definition, but is a valid property of ++.

<p>
</p></li><li> Page 67.  The definition for the append operator ++ using
<em>foldl</em> is not intended to be recursive, otherwise it won't
terminate.  In particular, the use of ++ in the body is supposed
to refer to the prelude version.  The following definition for
an append function has the correct behaviour:

<pre>   append   :: [a] -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]
   append xs = foldl (\ys y -&gt; ys ++ [y]) xs
</pre>


<p>
</p></li><li> Pages 74 to 78.  For technical reasons concerning the monadic
nature of parsers, a number of the basic definitions cannot be entered
directly as shown in the text, otherwise the Hugs system will produce
an error.  A link to a library file that makes the necessary changes,
and suggestions for further reading on the connection between parsers
and monads, is given in the chapter remarks on page 85.

<p>
</p></li><li> Page 76.  The function <em>result</em> defined in
the first line should be called <em>return</em>, and
the result of the first <em>parse</em> example 
should be [(1,"abc")]. (*)

<p>
</p></li><li> Page 89.  The action <em>putChar 'a'</em> writes the character
<em>a</em> to the screen, rather than <em>'a'</em>.

<p>
</p></li><li> Page 90. The action <em>getCh</em> is no longer
provided as a primitive in Hugs, but can be defined in Haskell as follows:

<pre>   import System.IO 

   getCh :: IO Char
   getCh  = do hSetEcho stdin False
               c &lt;- getChar
               hSetEcho stdin True
               return c
</pre>

<p>
This definition works with the Glasgow Haskell Compiler, but
may not work with some Haskell systems, such as Hugs.

</p><p>
</p></li><li> Page 91. The control characters used to define
the actions <em>beep</em>, <em>cls</em>, and <em>goto (x,y)</em> may
not work on some Haskell systems, such as WinHugs.

<p>
</p></li><li> Page 94.  The sentence beginning "That is, we can think of the
board as really being a torus," should conclude "which can be viewed as 
the surface of a three-dimensional doughnut shaped object". (*)

<p>
</p></li><li> Page 115.  The keyword <em>type</em> in exercise 3 should
be <em>data</em>.

<p>
</p></li><li> Page 120.  The number "33, 665, 406" should be formatted
as "33,665,406" with no spaces.  The same comment
applies to the other large numbers in this chapter.

<p>
</p></li><li> Page 127.  The word "rational" in the last line should
be "rationale".

<p>
</p></li><li> Page 136.  The example evaluation for <em>sumwith</em>
should have expressions of the form <em>sumwith $! v xs</em>
parenthesised as <em>(sumwith $! v) xs</em>.

<p>
</p></li><li> Page 140.  The additional "their" in the second paragraph
should be removed.

<p>
</p></li><li> Page 146.  The expression [<em>x</em>] ++ <em>ys</em> on the
fourth line should be [<em>x</em>] ++ <em>xs</em>, and the base
case calculation should be as follows: (*)

<pre>     reverse ([] ++ ys)
   =   { applying ++ }
     reverse ys
   =   { property of ++, see exercise 5 }
     reverse ys ++ []
   =   { unapplying reverse }
     reverse ys ++ reverse []
</pre>

<p>
</p></li><li> Page 147.  The first "the" in the last paragraph should be "than".

<p>
</p></li><li> Page 148.  The definition for <em>reverse</em> on the second
last line should be as follows: (*)

<pre>   reverse = foldl (\xs x -&gt; x : xs) []
</pre>

<p>
</p></li><li> Page 149.  The word "trees-like" in the first paragraph 
should be "tree-like".

<p>
</p></li><li> Page 151.  The word "to" on the second line should be removed. (*)

<p>
</p></li><li> Page 152.  The variable <em>ys</em> on the last line should be
<em>d</em>. (*)

<p>
</p></li><li> Page 155.  The first "a" in exercise 9 should be removed.

<p>
</p></li><li> Pages 158 and 159. The character functions
<em>isLower</em>, <em>isUpper</em>, <em>isAlpha</em>, <em>isDigit</em>,
<em>isAlphaNum</em>, <em>isSpace</em>, <em>ord</em>, <em>chr</em>,
<em>digitToInt</em>, <em>intToDigit</em>, <em>toLower</em>, and
<em>toUpper</em> listed in section A.3 are no longer part of the
standard prelude, but are included in a separate library called
<em>Char</em>.  This library can be loaded in a Hugs session by
entering the following command at the &gt; prompt:

<pre>   :load Char
</pre>

<p>
It can be loaded in a Haskell script by including the following
declaration at the start of the script:

</p><pre>   import Char
</pre>

<p>
</p></li><li> Page 161.  The library function <em>or</em> decides if any
logical value in a list is <em>True</em>, not <em>False</em>. (*)

<p>
</p></li><li> Page 167.  The journal "Communications of the ACM" in 
reference 11 should be "ACM Computing Surveys".
